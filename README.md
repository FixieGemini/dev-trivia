## Web Developer Trivia Questions
In Dev-Trivia the user is prompted to play a trivia game by pressing the play button. This begins a timer and the first multiple choice question then appears. The user has 4 answers to choose from, once an annswer is selected the a function determines whether or not they picked correctly. If they did answer correctly 10 points are added to their point totals. The next question appears regardless once they have made their choice and this continues until they have answered all the questions or their time runs out.
